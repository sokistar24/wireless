# Contention Window Optimization using Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the implementation of a reinforcement learning-based algorithm for optimizing contention windows in wireless networks with multiple access points. The goal is to enhance network performance and reduce channel access delay. The algorithm adaptively learns the optimal contention window sizes based on real-time network conditions, traffic patterns, and channel characteristics.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Tensorflow 2.x
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

Clone the repository:


The script will train the reinforcement learning agent, optimize the contention window, and display the performance metrics (e.g., network throughput, channel access delay, etc.).

## Customization

You can customize the network topology, number of access points, and other simulation parameters in the `config.py` file.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
